im still trying to understand how it works
ive got a book which in a chapter it explains about 'branch' on github. But github had defult name of main branch changed from "master" to "main" recently. And the book was published back in 2018 so discription in the book are changed and that got me confused for quite a while. "git pull origin master" written in that book doesnt work anymore that i finally realized.
