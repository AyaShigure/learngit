Im still trying to understand how it works.
I've got a book which in a chapter it explains about 'branch' on github. But github had default name of main branch changed from "master" to "main" recently. And the book was published back in 2018 and things like "git pull origin master" doesnt work and that got me confused for quite a while.

i wonder how messy could branches merging network be.wwwwwwwww
